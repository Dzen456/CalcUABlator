# Creative Process

This document explains the creative process of the project.

At first, we discussed a lot of posible ideas for a robot. After long deliverations, we came at the conclusion that it would be interesting to make a robot that would be capable of doing mathematical operations.

This robot may feel useless because there are already other resources that are capable of doing something similar without making a full-sized robot, for example, aplications like PhotoMath or webs like Symbolab, but we thought that it could have some interesting applications at some environments like a school, because it would be easier to teach math using this robot in a more autonomous way, than just writing an operation and making it manually. This, however, required to make a robot capable of doing the process of the operation too, which was inviable due to our time and resources, so we decided to make this robot as a kind of research that could be used at the future for other projects too. Also, these types of online services usually require cookies or other data-collecting methods that would be avoided if a robot is used instead, so it wasn't a bad idea to make something for that purpose.

Our first step was to decide the robot components without surpassing the budget, but we had to order too many things and we had to surpass the budget a bit, but nothing serious. We then started to model the robot: we had to do the base and decide the 3D pieces and the shape of the robot. This was more complex than it sounds, but then we got permission to use another robot as a base for our project, which was very useful and solved a lot of things.

We then started to make the simulation of the robot and we worked on the camera support for the robot as an additional piece. The simulation was made sucessfully and we got wood material from the OpenLabs of our department, material that we modified on these same instalations to obtain the support piece for the camera. We also made the fritzing to knew how the circuits of the robot would be conected for them to work and we also did the functions diagram to have an idea of what would be the programming structure of the robot.

Once we obtained the hardware that we requested, we finally were able to put all of the things together, and make the robot work. (to be continued...)
